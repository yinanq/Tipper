Tipper is a tip calculator iPhone5 app following Tim's tutorial (https://vimeo.com/102084767) as my prework for applying for CodePath class iOS(Swift) for Designers starting on 14Spe2015.

Time spent: 5.5 hours

Completed stories:

• Required: user can enter bill amount and select tip percentage to calculate tip amount and total amount

• Required: user can tap anywher outside of bill textfield and keyboard to hide keyboard

• Optional: custom font

• Optional: app icon

Notes:

• Couldn't find out why launch image wouldn't work

• Turned off status bar using Info.plist thanks to a Stack Overflow post

• Couldn't figure out how to have bill textfield auto-selected (and keyboard auto-opened) upon app launch
